# CCInventorySearch
Inventory search feature for CrossCode.

One rainy day I was going about bashing bushes for items, I had so many items that it was tedious to scroll through my inventory to find what I was looking for.
Thus I present a way to search your inventory by item name!

You are able to search by name and filter by item rarity.
